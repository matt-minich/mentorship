# mentorship
This repository contains R Markdown and Jupyter Notebook files that I have shared with other students and junior lab members in a mentorship capacity.
A guide to the docs below:

1. **STEP_1... to STEP_4...** - a set of Jupyter notebooks designed to help new staff members navigate the preprocessing and analysis procedures for the Communication, Brain and Behavior lab. Please note that 1) the language of this document is meant to be candid and conversational and 2) some new error language may appear in the document due to its separation from the (protected) original data
2. **Signal_Detection_Theory_Tutorial** - A .Rmd and .html files documenting a walkthrough of a simple signal detection analysis using simulated data.
3. **ANCOVA_Moderation_Tutorial** - A .html documenting a simple ANCOVA analysis test using another student's dissertation data.
